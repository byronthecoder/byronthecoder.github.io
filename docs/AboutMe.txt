This is a text file that contains information about me. It is used to help the AI understand my preferences and provide better responses.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in brain-inspired AI. I decode human intelligence in speech and language, aiming to enable machines to interact more naturally and intelligently. 

My current research focuses on the computational simulation and neural coding of language behaviour in social interactions, such as imitation and prediction, especially in speech rhythm and intonation. 

Iâ€™m also interested in AI for Education, specifically the gamification of language learning. 

My toolkit includes behavioural experiments, advanced signal processing, deep learning, and statistical analysis.

I have a background in linguistics and computer science.

I program in Python and have experience with machine learning and neural networks. I can also code in Java, R and MATLAB. 

I live in Aix-en-Provence, France. I am learning French. I have a 1400+ day streak on Duolingo.

I enjoy reading, board games, and playing the guitar. I am a fan of vintage video games.
