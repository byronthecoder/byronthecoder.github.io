Hello, I'm Zheng - or Byron if you prefer. I'm a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of brain science and AI, trying to unlock the secrets of how humans process speech and language and its relationship with intelligence.

Currently at Laboratoire Parole et Langage (Aix-Marseille University), I'm collaborating on the "Prosody AS Dynamic COordinative Device" project, where we use deep learning to explore the neural mechanisms underlying speech interaction, particularly how we imitate each other's rhythms and intonations.

I blend behavioral experiments, signal processing, and neural networks to simulate language behavior. I'm also passionate about AI for education, especially finding ways to make language learning more engaging through gamification.

When I'm not coding, you might find me hiking the beautiful landscapes around Provence, playing board games, strumming my guitar, or maintaining my 1400+ day streak on Duolingo (I'm learning French!). I'm also a bit of a vintage video game enthusiast.

Feel free to explore my publications or reach out if you're interested in collaborative research or just want to chat about brain-inspired AI!
