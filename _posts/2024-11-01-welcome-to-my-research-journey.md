Welcome to my academic blog! I'm excited to share this space where I'll be documenting my research journey, insights, and thoughts on the fascinating intersection of speech science, neurolinguistics, and artificial intelligence.

## About This Blog

This blog serves as a platform to:

- **Share research insights** from my work on speech entrainment and prosodic coordination
- **Discuss methodological approaches** in computational linguistics and neural signal processing
- **Explore the intersection** of human cognition and artificial intelligence
- **Document my journey** as a postdoctoral researcher at LPL, Aix-Marseille University

## My Research Focus

Currently, I'm working on the "**Prosody AS Dynamic COordinative Device**" project, investigating how speakers coordinate their prosodic patterns during natural conversation. This work combines:

### Deep Learning & Speech Processing

Using advanced neural network architectures to model complex temporal patterns in speech signals, particularly focusing on:

- Multi-scale prosodic feature extraction
- Real-time entrainment detection
- Cross-linguistic pattern analysis

### Neurolinguistic Mechanisms

Understanding the brain mechanisms underlying speech interaction through:

- EEG and fMRI signal analysis
- Computational modeling of neural synchronization
- Cross-modal integration studies

### Applied AI for Communication

Developing practical applications that enhance human-computer interaction:

- Conversational AI systems with natural prosodic patterns
- Speech therapy tools for communication disorders
- Educational technologies for language learning

## What to Expect

In upcoming posts, you'll find:

- **Technical tutorials** on speech processing with Python and deep learning frameworks
- **Research method discussions** covering experimental design and data analysis
- **Conference reflections** from INTERSPEECH, ICASSP, and other major venues
- **Collaboration stories** from my work with international research teams
- **Thoughts on open science** and reproducible research practices

## Join the Conversation

I believe in the power of collaborative research and open dialogue. Feel free to:

- Comment on posts with your thoughts and questions
- Share your own experiences in related research areas
- Suggest topics you'd like me to explore
- Connect with me on social media or via email

## Looking Forward

As we advance into an era where AI and human intelligence increasingly intersect, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of human communication becomes more crucial than ever. I hope this blog contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical neuroscience and practical AI applications.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Let's explore the beautiful complexity of human speech and cognition together!
