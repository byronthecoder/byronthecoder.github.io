## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in creating inclusive, engaging learning environments that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical applications. My multilingual background and interdisciplinary research experience inform my approach to education, emphasizing:

- **Active Learning**: Encouraging students to engage with material through hands-on activities and real-world applications
- **Cultural Awareness**: Incorporating diverse perspectives and cross-cultural examples
- **Technology Integration**: Using modern tools and platforms to enhance learning experiences
- **Individual Support**: Adapting to different learning styles and providing personalized guidance
