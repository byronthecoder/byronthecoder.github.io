## Project Overview

The AI Teacher Response System was developed as part of the BEA (Building Educational Applications) Shared Task 2023, where our team achieved **2nd place** in generating AI teacher responses in educational dialogues. This system leverages advanced natural language processing to create contextually appropriate and pedagogically sound responses in educational settings.

## Challenge Description

Educational dialogues present unique challenges:
- **Pedagogical Appropriateness**: Responses must guide learning without giving direct answers
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding student knowledge level and learning objectives
- **Engagement**: Maintaining student motivation and participation
- **Personalization**: Adapting to individual learning styles and needs

## Technical Architecture

### Transformer-based Model
Our solution employed a fine-tuned transformer architecture with several key innovations:

```python
class EducationalDialogueModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_model="bert-base-uncased"):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = AutoModel.from_pretrained(base_model)
        self.context_attention = MultiHeadAttention(768, 12)
        self.pedagogical_classifier = nn.Linear(768, 5)  # Teaching strategies
        self.response_generator = nn.Linear(768, vocab_size)
        
    def forward(self, input_ids, dialogue_history, student_profile):
        # Encode current input and dialogue history
        encoded = self.encoder(input_ids)
        
        # Apply context-aware attention
        context_aware = self.context_attention(
            encoded, dialogue_history, student_profile
        )
        
        # Classify appropriate teaching strategy
        strategy = self.pedagogical_classifier(context_aware)
        
        # Generate response conditioned on strategy
        response = self.response_generator(context_aware, strategy)
        
        return response, strategy
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Context Understanding Module
- **Dialogue History Analysis**: Tracking conversation flow and student progress
- **Student Modeling**: Inferring student knowledge state and learning patterns
- **Topic Detection**: Identifying current subject matter and learning objectives

#### 2. Pedagogical Strategy Classifier
- **Socratic Questioning**: Guiding students to discover answers independently
- **Scaffolding**: Providing structured support based on difficulty level
- **Encouragement**: Maintaining motivation and confidence
- **Clarification**: Addressing misconceptions and confusion
- **Challenge**: Extending learning with additional complexity

#### 3. Response Generation Engine
- **Template-free Generation**: Natural, contextual responses
- **Pedagogical Constraints**: Ensuring educational appropriateness
- **Personalization**: Adapting language and complexity to student level
